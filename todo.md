## Phase 1 Review

### What Was Implemented:

1. **Project Foundation**
   - Next.js 14+ with TypeScript configured
   - Tailwind CSS with custom design system matching design-specs.md
   - CSS custom properties for consistent theming
   - Inter font optimized with next/font

2. **Component Library**
   - Button component with primary, secondary, and urgency variants
   - Card component with tier and content variants
   - Accordion component for FAQ functionality
   - All components follow accessibility best practices

3. **Navigation System**
   - Sticky navigation with blur backdrop
   - Mobile hamburger menu (transforms at 768px)
   - Smooth scroll with section highlighting
   - Intersection Observer for active section detection

4. **Hero Section**
   - Animated statistics counters (50,000+ students, etc.)
   - Responsive layout with mobile-first approach
   - CTA buttons with proper hover states
   - Integration with LogoCarousel component

5. **Logo Carousel**
   - 35-second auto-scroll animation

### Key Design Decisions:
- Used CSS animations for performance over JavaScript

- [ ] Add loading states and skeleton screens
- [ ] Enhance performance optimization

### Technical Notes:
- All components use 'use client' directive for interactivity
- Tailwind config includes all design system values
- Path aliases configured (@/ points to src/)
- No console errors or warnings
- Basic accessibility compliance achieved
